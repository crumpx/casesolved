  text:  After being displeased with the Geek Squad I went here and couldn't be happier! They beat them on price, service, and they were about 10 times as fast. Thanks!

  text:  Pretty good and convenient to fix your electronis in ditmarts. The RAM on my Mac book pro from 2008 died so I went there and they changed it for me. So yeah they do Apple products as well. The price was fair and they took only a few days.

  text: They do a quick and efficient job and definitely charge a reasonable price for their services. The store is small and welcoming unlike other small cellphone shops that usually give off a shady vibe. It was a professional job well done. I'm sure I'll be using them again!

  text: If you're seeing this in search of a laptop repair, don't waste your time calling around all the places in the area (or in all of NYC for that matter) because I did that for you and Case Solved wins out and I left as one happy little camper.
